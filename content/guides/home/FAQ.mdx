## Boot FAQ

### What are the requirements?

The requirements are quite limited. To participate, your project must:

* **Boot successfully** as a functional operating system.
* **Differentiate itself** from the base OS (if you aren't building it from scratch).
* **Be properly packaged** in a standard format (such as `.iso` or `.img`).

### How is scoring determined?

You will receive a **multiplier** based on the complexity and creativity of your OS.

> **Example:** If a user simply replaces all occurrences of "Ubuntu" with their own name, re-themes the interface, and adds one or two apps, the project still counts. However, because it lacks significant complexity or original creativity, it would result in a lower coin reward.
