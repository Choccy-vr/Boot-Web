## Boot FAQ

### What are the requirements?

The requirements are quite limited. To participate, your project must:

* **Boot successfully** as a functional operating system.
* **Differentiate itself** from the base OS (if you aren't building it from scratch).
* **Be properly packaged** in a standard format (such as `.iso` or `.img`).

---

### How is scoring determined?

You will receive a **multiplier** based on the complexity and creativity of your OS.

> **Example:** If a user simply replaces all occurrences of "Ubuntu" with their own name, re-themes the interface, and adds one or two apps, the project still counts. However, because it lacks significant complexity or original creativity, it would result in a lower coin reward.

### How do I track time?

Use [Hackatime](https://hackatime.hackclub.com/)

---

### How do I track the time spent in VMs?

Currently, we don't have a solution to that **yet**.

---

### What are challenges?

Challenges are a way to increase complexity and creativity in an OS. You will have something to add to your OS, and you will get a prize for it. 

> **Example:** Create a custom Desktop Enviroment +1.5x multiplier!

### Where are the prizes???

### When does this start?

It depends on when we get a sponsor, but I would like the start of January or a little bit after Christmas.

---

### How do you earn Boot Coins?

For every hour you work on your OS, you get 10 Boot Coins. You can get a multiplier and more Boot Coins with challenges.

### I know nothing about creating a OS HELP!!!!!

Don't worry, we have guides and other resources to help you. Check out our [guides](https://www.boot-os.com/guides/home).

* If you are brand new, we suggest modifying an existing OS to make it your own.
